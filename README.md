Developed an advanced scheduling program to optimize project management workflows 📊. The system takes a list of activities with durations and their prerequisites, constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) 🗂️ to ensure proper task dependencies. By leveraging Tarjan's algorithm for depth-first traversal, the program performs topological sorting of activities 🔄, determining their sequence. It calculates and prints the earliest and latest start times for each task ⏰, providing valuable insight into project timelines. Additionally, the program identifies critical activities 🔑 that influence the overall project duration and displays the total project time ⏳, making it an essential tool for effective time management and resource allocation.
